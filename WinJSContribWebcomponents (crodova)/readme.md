This sample shows how to use controls with webcomponents syntax in WinJS.

Read this [blog post](http://mcnextpost.com/2015/04/26/using-winjs-controls-as-webcomponents/) to get more details, and [this one](http://mcnextpost.com/2015/04/27/registering-your-winjs-webcomponents/) for more information about how to register your own controls.

If you want to compare with vanilla WinJS, you could start by comparing the searchbar control from this project (Flickity\Flickity.Shared\controls\searchbar) with the one in the pure WinJS sample.
